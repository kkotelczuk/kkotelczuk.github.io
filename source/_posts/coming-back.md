## What happends
It has been a while since the last blog post. All because of that I quit my job. Last weeks I spend on looking some interesting work. It's kind of difficult tasks, because there is a lot of work in `PHP`, mostly `WordPress` or `e-commerce`. But I want to work as `Front End` developer in one of newest frameworks and `Node.js` of course. 
### This post will not be about interviews its self, but about my observations about it. 
The first thing worth to mention is that you should have wide knowledge about programming at all, not only about your preferred language. I had some questions about algorithms time complexity. 
**```It's good to know how it works and how to calculate time and space complexity. ```**
There was no question about complexity of specific function, but about the whole solution, and if complexity was too big, how you can improve it. Such questions just check your way of thinking and ability to solving problems. 
When going to interview its good practice to be alway prepared for some tricky task to solve. For example, in JS you should be able to say what happened if **`Timeout will be set to 0`**. Maybe not so difficult, but this solution is not used very often and may be bit problematic. 
On interviews, there is always question from those classic which can be found on the Internet for example in [JS Handbook](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2017/practice/interview-q.html)
Always but always you have to be prepared for a question like _```Why you want to work with us?```_ or _```What do you know about us?```_
I have to admit that once I wasn't prepared. I lost my chance to work with this company, because of my ignorance so, remember to always check company website, Facebook, LinkedIn and their product or products if there is such an opportunity. 

And for now, my most important observation is that **finding a good, well-paid job needs a time**. There is a lot of work in web development, but not a lot of interesting projects or working in new technologies. So be prepared for a long time searching. 
That's all, next post will be about ReDrawIt update. 

## Stay cool!
