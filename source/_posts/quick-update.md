#Quick Update

Huh, it was really hard week. I have done some research about npm, so now I can say that I understand it's quite well. During this week I didn't focus on my project. Unfortunately I have time only tonight. So here is what I'm going to do. 

I decided to build this whole project from scratch. Without any boilerplates or any old projects. Just begin with install react and mobX and see what next. 

The first thing I want to do is simple tic tac toe games, just like in react tutorial. I want to build it just for test if my configuration works fine. After that I will begin writing project from auth component.

That's the plan.
