## Welcome!

This is my very first personal blog post. I want to take part in a competition **Get Noticed!** 2017 edition. 

My name is Konrad and I'm working as Front End developer in a small company named [Eyedea](http://eyedea.io/). I'm also member of community named [Hacklag](https://hacklag.org/), which makes great things for IT people in my town. I graduated [Technical University in Bia≈Çystok](http://pb.edu.pl/). It was the crazy time and I miss it so I need some challenges. 

**The first challenge** that I take is writing this blog in English. I want to learn how to write as good as it is possible, so please check me and correct without mercy ;)

**The second challenge**, I think even bigger is begun my own open source project. I have a lot of worries about it, but I have to face it!

So let's begin my journey. Next time I will describe my project.
