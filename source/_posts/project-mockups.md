# Project Mockups

Yesterday I wanted weak, but how if I really don't now how my game should look like. I decided to prepare some mockups. It's just drafting. I think colors, graphics, fonts may change. 

## Mockup tool

One of my terrible problems is using any graphic tool. I can use paint, for editing images but when it comes to Photoshop or Illustrator I'm just weak. I'm also weka at designing but hey! It's my idea so I can try, right? This time I hade used tool that I know quite well - Figma. Figma is simple interface design tool which is really easy for beginners. AND it's free right now (forever free for students). With some ideas and the right tool, I had to begin my work. 

## ReDrawIt first mockups

Fist screen is, of course, simple as it can be. Just login page without any other functions. In concept, there is no signup option. Just pure fun.

After select player name (or use default) Player begins drawing. I think there could be modal with some basic info and some kind of countdown. At this moment player can't use any other tool than a 4px pencil with various colors. Whiteboard would be something like 200px on 200px or more but it has to be square.

Next section shows a picture to redraw. The previously drawn image is sent to an author of that picture which player have to redraw. Then they got same time to redraw pictures.

After that the system automatically checks who wins.

I know that is potentially insecure and there is a lot of options to hack it, but don't forget this is the only idea, first concept. 
If you have any suggestions I will be glad to hear it.
